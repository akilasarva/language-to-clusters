"""Pure-Python cursor for walking a tree-shaped NavPlan inside ``brain_controller``.

Extracting this from ``brain_controller`` keeps the tree-traversal logic
independently unit-testable (no ROS, no OpenAI) and keeps the controller
free of bookkeeping noise — the controller just calls
:meth:`advance` after linear steps complete and :meth:`descend` after a VLM
branch decision.

Plan JSON shape consumed by this navigator
------------------------------------------

The plan is the brain-flavoured dict produced by
``nl_planner.branch_materializer.to_brain_tree`` (cluster_ids resolved).
Each step is::

    {
        "step":           int,
        "description":    str,
        "start_cluster":  int,
        "goal_cluster":   int,
        "start_mode":     str | None,      # diagnostic
        "goal_mode":      str | None,      # diagnostic
        "transition_cue": str | None,
        "notes":          str | None,
        "branches":       None | [
            {"vlm_cue": str, "sub_plan": [<more steps>]},
            ...
        ],
    }

Semantics
---------
- A step with ``branches`` is a *decision step*. After its goal cluster is
  reached (and any cue confirmed), the controller calls a VLM to pick a
  branch, then calls :meth:`descend` with that branch index. Anything in
  the parent ``steps`` list AFTER the decision step is unreachable — the
  branch's ``sub_plan`` becomes the new active sequence.
- A leaf path (linear ``sub_plan`` with no decisions, or the tail of one)
  finishes by calling :meth:`advance` past its last step, which flips
  :attr:`is_complete` to ``True``.

The schema validator in ``nl_planner.schemas`` already enforces:
- every decision step has at least 2 branches and exactly one ``"default"``
- nested branching depth ≤ ``MAX_BRANCH_DEPTH`` (3)
- ``sub_plan`` is non-empty

so this navigator does not re-validate; it raises ``RuntimeError`` /
``ValueError`` on programmer error only.

        That is fatal for the scoped approach query, whose entire point is to ask BEFORE

        standing in it, because no question was ever asked on the way in.
